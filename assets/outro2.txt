As you arrive to the deck, you find it empty.&
Where did it go ? Where is your ship ?&
With your last chance to survive gone,&
in your last moments, you wonder.&
How could it disappear ? No signs of it&
getting destroyed, the deck was secured.&
Did someone betray you ? Who ?&
Your admiral, whose words you always&
trusted blindly ? Or some higher-ups ?&
You will never know, as it ends here.&
....&
....&
As your time runs out it hits you:&
'Fucking animal took it !'&
....&
....&
Those were your last words.#
